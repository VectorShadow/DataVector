Transmit data as bytestreams, where each byte translates directly to a char in the range 32-126.

Individual transmissions are bounded by curly braces, individual elements bounded by pipes, so:

{dataElement|dataElement|dataElement|dataElement}

Parse an incoming bytestream as in similar systems, separating the stream into transmissions and handling them chronologically.

Error handling for corrupted packets.

Encryption needs to be tweaked to avoid encrypting anything as a reserved symbol.
